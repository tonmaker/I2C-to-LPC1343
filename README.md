After researching so much information about migrating to ARM NXP, I had a lot of difficulty working with the I2C of the LPC1343, with a lot of confusing information and few results.
I decided to post my own library for those who have the same difficulty as me. I created it in a simple and direct way, as I like to do in my libraries.

Feel free.
Learning is good, sharing is even better.
